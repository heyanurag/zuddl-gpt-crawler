Currently, Zuddl notifies you of the following attendee actions:User registrationRegistrant check-in to the event (first time joining)This integration sends notifications in a selected Slack channel and also to the following recipients in the order of availability in Salesforce:Account ownerContact ownerLead ownerBefore sending the notification, the integration checks for the registrant\\u2019s email address in Salesforce in the following manner: if a Contact exists with the same email and is associated with an account, the integration notifies the account owner. If an account owner does not exist in Salesforce, it notifies the contact owner. If the email is not present as contact, then the integration checks if a lead exists with the same email. If it exists, the integration notifies the selected Slack channel and the lead owner.Note: If any of the recipients are not in Slack, the integration sends only channel notifications.\\u00a0Note: This is one-way integration support only for Slack and does not push any notification on Salesforce.PrerequisitesBefore we begin the integration, ensure you have the following:A logged-in Slack workspace account.A logged-in Salesforce account with access to all leads, contacts and accounts.StepsNote: It is recommended that you stay signed in before you start installing the app.Go to your organizer dashboard.Go to\\u00a0Integrations.From the integration listing page, click\\u00a0View details\\u00a0on the Slack+Salesforce tile.\\u00a0On the Slack app details page, click\\u00a0Install app.On the Slack authentication page, click on\\u00a0New authentication. This initiates the new authentication creation flow.Note: If an account has already been added and you want to add another account, Click\\u00a0Add a new account.Enter\\u00a0Your\\u00a0authentication name. Your authentication can be used to search your account from the list.Select\\u00a0Production\\u00a0for the\\u00a0Salesforce instance type.Click\\u00a0Create. This takes you through the Salesforce authentication page.\\u00a0Note: If you aren\\u2019t already signed in to your Salesforce account, you would be taken through the sign-in process.After you\\u2019ve granted all the permissions required for Zuddl on the Salesforce authentication page, click\\u00a0Next.
